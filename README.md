# Invisible Valuables Mod

This is a simple mod for the game R.E.P.O. designed for content creators.

## What does it do?

The mod makes all valuables completely invisible. However, their colliders still exist, so they can be picked up by the player and extracted through the Extraction Point.

## Main Use

It’s ideal for recording videos and getting clean shots of the extraction beam in action without objects cluttering the scene.

**WARNING!** This mod makes the game virtually unplayable in a normal way, as you won’t be able to see where the items are to collect them. Use it only for cinematic purposes.

## Installation

It is recommended to install using r2modman or the Thunderstore Mod Manager.

## Source Code

The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Gambrinus69/REPO-InvisibleValuablesMod).
